Hi ☺️ happy you're here! I am Onyinye, a frontend engineer with additional expertise in WordPress custom design.

🚀 Here's a little more about me:

So I'm a web developer and I love what I do. I would have said I'm passionate and creative but I don't want to bore you. Here's something fresh for you: I'm the developer you need to work with if you value perfection and you care for someone meticulous. I work best when developing from Figma designs, be sure you will get the exact specifications down to the minute details. I am fluent with Nextjs, React and Tailwind. I have mastered the rudiments of SEO and clean coding rules.

But here's something more important: I learn fast and I am always open to reviews and adopting new technology. Wondering why that is important? It's because technology changes rapidly, an expert in one stack becomes a dummy tomorrow once a new tool is out and the other obsolete. So above expertise I am a forward thinker. Love me already or wish to know me more?
